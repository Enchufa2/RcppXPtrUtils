## Patch release

Fixes some error messages.

The maintainer's address has changed. It is the same account, just a different
alias. I'm sending confirmation from the previous address to CRAN-submissions.

## Test environments

* Fedora 29 + GCC + clang (local), R 3.5.1
* Ubuntu 14.04 + GCC (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4, 3.5.1, devel
* win-builder, R devel

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies

Shouldn't be affected by this minimal patch.
